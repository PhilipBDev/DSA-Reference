/*

A brute force algorithm finds a solution by trying all possible answers and picking the best one.

Say you're a cashier and need to give someone 67 cents (US) using as few coins as possible. How would you do it?
You could try running through all potential coin combinations and pick the one that adds to 67 cents using the fewest coins. 
That's a brute force algorithm, since you're trying all possible ways to make change.
